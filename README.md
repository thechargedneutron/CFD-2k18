## Motivation

Natural Calamities are events which are spontaneous and very difficult to predict. The fatalities are significant and all we can do is to save once we are hit by one. But now with advancing technology we must devise methods to predict natural disasters. We can no longer wait for the event to come and then save ourselves.

## Our Focus

In this hackathon our focus is on *Forest Fires*. Forest fires are very frequent in areas including middle Africa and also California.
